This directory contains source code for profiling utilities that it
may be useful for customers to customize.

tbanal
------

The tbanal program reads a binary file containing raw ZBbus sample
data as captured by zbtraced from a Linux target, by libsbprof, or by
another software platform using the Broadcom profiling code.

Please see the source code or the tbanal man page (included in the
SiByte performance tools distribution) for more details on its usage.
