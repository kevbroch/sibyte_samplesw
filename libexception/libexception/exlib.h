   When the exception handling library handles an exception it saves
   the machine state into this structure.  It passes a pointer to the
   structure to exception handlers.

   Note that the FP state saved depends on the flags used to link the
   library, i.e., if a soft-float library is used no FP registers will
   ever be saved, and 16- vs. 32-register mode (Status:FR) is chosen
   at link time.  Don't change Status:FR at run time and expect the
   result to work.  */
