version 1.3

1.3	General release build, 2005-02-04.

	Moved SiByte header files into the 'include/sibyte' directory.

	Made various minor improvmenets to the BCM1250/BCM1125 header
	files.  Actually included the BCM1x55/BCM1x80 header files in
	this release.  (They were accidentally omitted in the previous
	release.)
	
	Removed non-functional example programs, including the
	'cfe_based_standalone' directory and the 'sb1250' directory.
	New or revised examples will almost certainly appear in some
	future release of this software collection.

	Added experimental support to libexception to allow operation
	on MIPS32 CPUs.  (The library has some known inefficiencies when
	running on MIPS32 CPUs, but at this time the support is intended
	to be used for experimentation only.)

	Adapt libsbprof's sbprof_cpu_speed() function to work on the
	BCM1x80/BCM1x55 families of parts.  (Use of the library on those
	parts has not been tested extensively at this time.)

1.2	General release build, 2004-12-07.

	Added an IPv4 checksum routine (csum_partial.S) to the
	collection of routines optimized for SB-1, in sb1-opt.

	Fixed LP64 issues in libexception and libsbprof.

	Added memcpy/memset example program to the libsbprof examples.

	Adapted Paired-Single demonstration headers (psingle)
	to work with versions of GCC which include MIPS Paired-Single
	support (e.g., the Specifix 2004e_341 toolchain).

	Added support for BCM1480, BCM1455, BCM1280, and BCM1255 to
	the SiByte include files.

	Added a CP0 PRID register decoding example that demonstrates
	the processor revision number conversion discussed in the
	SB1-AN100-R Application Note.

1.1	General release build, 2004-05-20.

	Added libmips_fpu, a header and library to allow easy
	manipulation of the MIPS FPU control registers.

	Reworked libexception and libsbprof configure scripts slightly.

	Added new libexception example to show a very simple facility
	to do stack pseudo-traces.

	Reimplement Paired-Single FPU demonstration headers to use pure
	inline functions and to avoid "volatile" asm qualifiers, to
	allow better optimization.

	Minor cleanups and additions to the BCM1250 header files.

	Added some additional sample code, demonstrating building
	standalone programs from CFE sources, and some additional
	ethernet sample programs.

	Added a demonstration of MIPS unaligned access exception handling.

1.0.27	Version bump for development after release.

1.0.26	General release build, 2004-02-23.

1.0.25	Add cache error handling example code.  Some header file
	cleanups and minor additions.

1.0.24	Version bump for development after release.

1.0.23	General release build, 2003-10-21.

1.0.22	Makefile changes and change branches to subroutine calls
	in *.S files.

1.0.21  Cleaned up some problems with out of date files in smbus
        code.

1.0.20	Added some additional CP0 defines to sbmips.h.

1.0.19	Version bump for development after release.

1.0.18	General release build, 2003-10-03.

1.0.17	Fixed asm constraints in libsbprof, and while there
	improved asm efficiency.  Updated sb1250/bringup/sbstart
	to use new sources.  Added some JTAG-related definitions.

1.0.16	Tweaked the name of the source tarball that's built.

1.0.15	Version bump for development after release.

1.0.14	General release build, 2003-09-05.

1.0.13	Added the "sb1-opt" directory, which contains standard C library
	functions optimized for SB-1.

1.0.12	Made some libsbprof routines public so apps can get access
	to the buffer, added flags to init routine for quieting 
 	noisy messages on exit, fixed some minor bugs.

1.0.11	Added tests to some headers, to be compatible with new compilers.

1.0.10	Removed unneeded files in sb1250/nbringup/common/fsim

1.0.9	Version bump for development after release.

1.0.8	General release build, 2003-07-09.

1.0.7	Fixed headers' conditional feature inclusion macros to do the
	right thing for 1250 C stepping features.

1.0.6	Add defines in sb1250_scd.h for additional watchdog timer
	register fields (most of which have been present forever, but
	one of which is new in BCM1250 "C" steppings).

1.0.5	Fix memory test compiler (in sb1250/bringup/mc) to build on
	RedHat 9 systems.

1.0.4	Bug fix in sb1250_scd.h.

1.0.3	Version bump for development after release.

1.0.2	General release build, 2003-06-06.

1.0.1	Added 'util' subdirectory in libsbprof to hold
	source code for tbanal (relocated from perfsamplesw).

1.0.0	Started tracking samplesw versions.
